# TaskTracker

## Design Decisions

So I designed the webapp so that you can register, login/out as in husky_shop.
Also, When you are logged in, on the homepage, a 'Create Tasks' and 
'Edit Tasks' are shown

## Operations

Once creating a user and logging in, create some tasks. Now the app will display
3 categories of tasks, unassigned, assigned to your current user, and completed
by your current user. You can assign currently unassigned tasks to other users, 
mark tasks completed, 
to you as completed, or

### User 
A User is, a name and an email address.

### Task
A Task is, a title, description, done, time_spent, and a user_id associated
with a user.
