# TaskTracker

## Design Decisions

So I designed the webapp so that you can register, login/out as in husky_shop.
Also, When you are logged in, on the homepage, a 'Create Tasks' and 
'View Assigned Tasks' are shown which redirect you to the new, and index 
forms respectively. Users can also always navigate home by clicking on the header.

### User 
A User is, a name and an email address.

### Task
A Task is, a title, description, done, time_spent, and a user_id associated
with a user.
