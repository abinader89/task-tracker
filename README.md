# TaskTracker

## Design Decisions

So I designed the webapp so that you can register, login/out as in husky_shop.
Also, When you are logged in, on the index, a show tasks is shown which redirects
you to the tasks index. From there, you can make a new task given the title,
description, and the integer associated with the user you are assigning it to.
